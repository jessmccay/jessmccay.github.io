                       <!-- I attended a Ruby on Rails bootcamp called <a href="https://www.learnacademy.org/" target="_blank">Learn Academy</a>. Learn was an intensive and thrilling 40 hours per week for 3 months of instruction and coding. I studied HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, Ruby on Rails, PSQL and more. I practiced utilizing various gems as well as plugins. I was lucky enough to spend a month with the lovely people of <a href="http://www.thoughtstem.com/home" target="_blank">ThoughtSTEM</a>, a local company teaching kids to code. During my time there I learned React and came up with alogorithms for code to help better organize and improve functionality of their site. I participated in code reviews, weekly code lessons and development team meetings. -->

                <p>I'm a software engineer who has just relocated to Detroit, Michigan. I landed a dream job and now I am learning all I can about Java, Springboot and SSIS. I'm a huge advocate for mob programming and I have been lucky enough to land a job where I get to do that!
                 I am so passionate about being a woman in tech and hope to inspire more girls to find their passion too. This process has been incredible and has shown me the power of always reaching to know more.

                <p class="boxes">OBE Systems was a website I created for a client. My client had certain requests and requirements in which he needed for his site. He previously had a webiste that was built in the 90's, needless to say it was so very outdated! Someone I had the pleasure of working with in my internship connected me with her husband, Mr. Oberman. I used this opportunity to turn it into a project for my team, MPS Devs. We used html, bootstrap and css to revamp the OBE Systems brand. We used the agile process to deliver Mr. Oberman request of simple and user friendly.<a href="https://jessmccay.github.io/obe_systems" target="_blank" > Here</a>  is the sample of his site. This version has a view placeholders, other than this is is what the live site will look like.</p>

                <h2>Landmarked!</h2>
                <p class="boxes">Landmarked! is an app that allows the user to discover and share unique and exciting landmarks in their local area. The user is able to follow other landmarkers, search for, rate and save landmarks as well as upload their own discoveries. This was my final project in my bootcamp, Learn Academy. I collaborted with 5 other developers. I helped come up with the concept of the ruby on rails application, write stories and participate in a daily scrum. I personally was responsible for applying devise and ominiath to assist in the user sign up and log in. I also designed the sign up and log in pages. I wrote code to hide the sign up/log in links once the user is already successfully logged in. I also wrote code to allow the user to favorite landmarks and to display the landmarks on their personal profile pages. I wrote many rspec and capybera tests, to ensure stability of the code.</p>
